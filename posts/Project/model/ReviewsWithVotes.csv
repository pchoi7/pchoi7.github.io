The course lectures are clear and well-connected to the readings. Along with publishing lecture slides on Canvas, Gregg provides supplementary Panopto videos for both review and further exploration into certain topics. Surfacing this course are historical facts, such as the technologies of the British Industrial Revolution (e.g. steam engine, spinning jenny) and periods of Japan (e.g. Tokugawa, Meiji). Underlying this are widely generlizable takeaways about institutions, marketplaces, and how economies develop. I often rely on information taught in this course during my current J-Term class. The grading distribution is as follows: problem sets (20%), which usually take 1-2 hours to complete and are very easy; essays (25%), which require a strong foundational understanding of certain readings and adherence to a set rubric; exams (45%), which includes an in-person short-response style exam and an asynchronous long-response question... on the easier side if you pay attention. The remaining 10% is attendance and weekly reading responses. My 10hrs/wk was definitely overkill. Overall, I absolutely loved this class and think it (and Gregg) are among the strongest in the econ department! "

Sustainable Finance covers the institutions, organizations, and players that comprise the international financial architecture. With an implicit focus on incentives, the class walks through financial arrangements and how they further – or hinder – progress toward a ""sustainable"" future. The course delivers some basic but harrowing realizations. For example, since ESG-related KPIs are usually not incorporated into valuation, the most socially-optimal businesses are undervalued. Similarly, the nations most exposed to climate risk are also the riskiest borrowers, leading to high lending rates. In other words, the nations with the highest needs face the highest costs, depriving them of much-needed capital. Frank teaches this information through a mixture of lectures and guest speaking sessions. He publishes all slides on Google Drive along with support information. The grading breakdown is as follows: exams (40%), which require careful memorization of small details and connecting them to broader takeaways; final project (35%), which is a behemoth two-person project with a written and oral component; participation and other smaller assignments (25%). In addition to the course, Frank tries to get his students actively involved, which includes making connections, extending invites to host panels, and so forth.

Every week you’ll have an online assignment with 15-20 problems usually from the week but we only had to get 85% correct to get all points for it. There is also a feedback assignment which is like 5 questions but much more difficult and usually with multiple parts. Big benefit with Professor Crodelle (probably others too?) is you can redo Feedback assignments and quizzes within the week to try improving your grade. But it’s definitely medium/fast paced, you gotta keep up, ask questions if you don’t know something, it’s not a class you can suffer in silence on bc it’ll get a lot worse if you do. I’ve enjoyed the class overall just as it’s something to think about, but there are definitely times you might regret signing up for it bc nothing makes sense. Anyway, in summary it’s a tough course but if you’re up for it, it’s good, I liked professor Crodelle although I believe our class had mixed opinions, and if you understood calc 1 decently enough you can survive this class. Oh one other thing is you’re theoretically supposed to do readings every day in the textbook but I think I only did the first 2 or 3 because that would add so much homework time and she goes over the main points in class. just take good notes."

I am now finding the class much better and since Kubacki is very kind and good at lecturing, I think this is a great linear algebra class. The homework is manageable and the grading is reasonable. There is a weekly problem set and you can submit revisions of it to receive full points. The exams were reasonably difficult and you are allowed a sheet of notes front and back. There were projects throughout the semester as well, which were a bit difficult. I also did not particularly like the grading system. You basically start with 400 points and every time you lose points on an assignment or exam, they are subtracted from your total and cannot be regained.

The course introduced me to the rigorous study of real numbers and their properties, including limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and sequences and series. We started by exploring the foundations of real analysis, including the axioms of the real numbers and the concept of completeness.

The course was heavily proof-based, and we spent a significant amount of time constructing and presenting rigorous mathematical proofs. This helped me to develop my analytical skills and to appreciate the beauty of mathematical reasoning.

One of the most challenging aspects of the course was learning how to think abstractly about mathematical concepts. We had to develop a lot of intuition for how real numbers behave, which often involved visualizing abstract concepts in our minds.

But as we progressed through the course, we began to see how these abstract concepts could be applied to real-world problems. For example, we used real analysis to study the behavior of functions and to analyze the convergence of sequences and series.

Overall, I found the undergraduate real analysis course to be a challenging but rewarding experience. It pushed me to think in new ways and to develop my mathematical skills, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing mathematics at a higher level."

It culminated in an actual deliverable program, a final report of all findings (about 20 pages for me), and two presentations (one at the symposium and one to business partners).  This means there was lots of opportunities to gain skills, conduct independent research, and create actual value.  This is definitely one of my favorite courses I've taken here at Midd.

But Professor Foley's Data Structures class will prepare you even better for the real world.
In the John Foley experience, real-life applicability is a priority.
Foley uses Java 11, which prepares you well in the world of software development as of 2022.
Foley also uses GitHub for assignments, so you can get a taste of git, a very useful skill.
His assignments repo is a full Java project, so you have access to industry-standard tools and development workflows.
Instead of jumping right into trees and sorting algorithms, Foley spends the first half of the course introducing Java (and with it, built-in data structures). We actually use Java's built-in data types to a great extent, because in a real-world setting, that is usually better than code a CS professor wrote solely to teach.
Given COVID fatigue, he skimmed over some specialized data structures near the end of the course and made it less stressful.
A very important aspect of the Foley experience is that tests are available to you, unlike Gradescope where the actual tests are hidden. Since those tests were written against built-in data structures, if your code passes these tests, then you can be 99% sure that you have done everything correctly, and 99% sure that you will get full credit on this assignment. There are also optional opportunities to write your own tests, against broken classes purposefully designed to help you.
Overall, the Foley experience closely resembles what actual software engineers are doing every day. I strongly recommend taking it."

For the workload – this is a novel-a-week course, which usually entailed 6-12 hours of reading. I tended more towards the upper pole due to annotations and note-taking. During exam or essay weeks, I would find myself spending north of 15 hours on assignments, because (as others will remark) she grades papers rather thoroughly. Millier was generous enough to give me an A, but not before working me like a mule. 

In all seriousness, Millier's passion for and mastery of literature made for a fantastic course. Selected works include The Scarlet Letter, Walden, and Moby [lol], each of which she knew intimately. Millier was similarly accessible and helpful during office hours, and she was surprisingly open to reviewing first drafts of essays. Her overall mixture of accommodation and challenge suited my non-literature background well. While taking this course a second time would give me pause, I'm grateful that I took it once.

It at first seemed like a lot of work (with all the reading) to me, but there are no papers in the course, only weekly discussion posts. I was surprised that classes are mostly lectures with little discussion, but now I like this style as we learn lots of interesting things about the play. Every Thursday we have a quiz on the play, but they're usually fairly easy as it is only about things he has talked about in class. As for Billings as a teacher, I have not noticed or experienced any of the issues other students have had with him in the past. He seems to value everyone's opinions equally and is very careful around issues of race and sexuality that arise in the play. Overall I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks they might be able to find Shakespeare interesting and is willing to commit to reading the plays. I enjoyed doing the homework each week and am always happy to attend the class."

Also, since it was offered as a J-term class, I could really immerse myself in the course materials/ discussions, which enriched my days.

I was not initially interested by the subject matter, instead only taking the course because it was a 300-level math class that both counted toward my major and knocked out a CW requirement. The workload in this course was immense, consisting of the following tracks of assignments: (1) a track of four reflection papers over the course of the semester to reflect on writing and being a mathematician; (2) a biography of an underrepresented mathematician working in applied/computation math; (3) a major paper written collaboratively on presenting singular value decomposition (SVD) to an audience of Linear Algebra students; and, most importantly, (4) a sequence of 7-8 homework assignments formatted as technical reports, including abstracts, introduction, conclusion, appendices, and the problem solutions formatted and written narratively. This course only consisted of 10 students in the Fall 2022 semester, and a survey of all them of them partway through the semester revealed that all 10 of us were spending between 15 and 25 hours per week outside of class on the assignments each week, due to the fact that the different tracks were stacked on top of each other. This issue was resolved after an email was sent to Professor Kubacki explaining the situation, and she was extremely understanding and could not believe that we went to her sooner. This issue aside, the lectures were still rather weirdly paced, focusing intensely on some seemingly trivial matters while glossing over other things. Furthermore, while there was ultimately an arc to the course -- a tale in how Numerical Analysis is done -- this was not revealed to us until the end, the effect being that the previous 8 weeks felt like doing random unmotivated steps in the dark. While the writing skills were useful, and the diversity, equity, inclusion discussions were awkward but interesting, but overall the time sacrifice to get there did not justify the means for me."

Micro Theory focuses on the behaviors of individual actors within institutions, particularly how people respond to the decisions of others. The course content is exciting: basic game theory, best-response functions, and deeply confusing graphs that resemble topographic maps. Here, the course setup was as follows: five exams with the lowest score dropped (70%) and five problem sets with all scores counting (30%). Both are difficult: the problem sets took between 4-10 hours, while the exams come with time pressure and leave little margin for checking work. That said, Matthews is a very forgiving grader — maybe overly so at times — and extremely helpful during office hours. More broadly, taking this course with Matthews guarantees three things. Firstly, you will be cold-called: he prints a random list of all students and calls on 10-25 of them each class. Secondly, you will attend office hours: on the eve of Thanksgiving break, roughly three-quarters of the class attended OHs to discuss the problem set. (Matthews, of course, stayed until everyone left). Thirdly, you will get a macro twist: Matthews connects the course concepts to general truths, including how the choices of rational actors cause inefficient outcomes and how institutional arrangements make or destroy markets. My only complaint is that because Matthews adopts a cold-calling, conversation-centric approach to teaching, he provides a less structured (clear?) experience than other professors.

Indigenous History is best described as a series of interconnected case studies, ranging from the Aztecs to the modern-day Yanomamo. Through assigning historical accounts and ethnographies, Stoll teaches both concrete historical knowledge and general themes, including mythology, theology, and essentialism. Reading is imperative: each class section consisted of Stoll interspersing his oral lecture with 10-20 questions based on the assigned works. Consequently, 20% of the course grade is participation. The remaining 80% is three papers and a final project. As others have noted, Stoll's essay prompts are challenging, for they require making arguments that are often only partly covered by the readings, if at all. Many require drawing connections between texts, including implicit arguments made by different authors. Furthermore, Stoll allows students to create their own prompt when appropriate; such is required for the final research project. As a non-Anthro major, this constellation of readings, inferences, outlining, and writing challenged me. But I now feel more confident in my analytical, communication, and writing skills. Stoll also provides ample feedback on both drafts and submitted work, especially if you use his office hours. (Would strongly recommend doing so – along with being helpful, Stoll is a character with a wealth of stories to tell). Overall, I'm thrilled to have taken this course... even if it verged on ""Type II Fun"" at times. Hope to take another with him! "

The course covered a range of topics, including basic set theory, continuity, open and closed sets, compactness, connectedness, and the fundamental group. We started with an overview of topology and its relation to metric spaces, which provided a good foundation for the rest of the course.

One of the most challenging aspects of the course was learning how to think in terms of topological spaces. We had to develop a lot of intuition for how topological spaces behave, which often involved visualizing abstract concepts in our minds. But as we progressed through the course, we began to see how these abstract concepts could be applied to real-world problems.

The course also emphasized the importance of proofs, which was a valuable skill to develop. We learned how to construct and present rigorous proofs for the theorems and propositions we encountered. This helped us to develop a deeper understanding of the material and to appreciate the beauty of mathematical reasoning.

Overall, I found the undergraduate topology course to be a rewarding and enlightening experience. It challenged me to think in new ways and to develop my mathematical skills, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in pursuing mathematics at a higher level."
